**Prologue One – Millennium**

### Narrator

Boom.

Lightning struck. The choir chanted. The violins played. And the drums, they rumbled. 

And... slowly, it started to rain. It rained crystal glass, stained by red blood.

Soldiers fell. 

Men fell.

" War. That’s what started everything. It's also what ended everything. Thousands of years of lust, greed and thirst for blood and power shaped it all, from the chains of shard like mountains, to scattered space debris frozen in time, to the makeshift cityscapes like metallic, synthetic mold.
It shaped all you see before you. " he said in a gravelly voice.


And with one crashing big bang, the night skies lit up like a trillion stars.

Bang.

Then everything went dark. 

Everything went dark for a really really long time…

**Prologue Two – Expedition One**


### Conductor

" ALL ABOARD ! " he shouted in voice like a foghorn.

The conductor wore a beautiful velvet blue coat that fell to his knees like a water fall. 
He exhaled loudly through his rough brown beard sprinkled with silver strands. Then, he inhaled heavily without moving his large pupils, stomach bulging, a glass tablet in his left hand, which gave him a smiling puppet like look. 

" CONDUCTOR TO ALL EXPLORERS. ALL ABOARD ! " he repeated raucously. 

He squinted as he carefully scanned the platform, grimacing in contempt whenever his gazed met any of travelers rushing to the gates. Although most had already boarded their designated vessels, the few late that hurried to their seats were all different from one after the other. The conductor caught a young teen scraping her puffy bags unto the platform floor. She dropped her tickets only to come rushing back to grab then as they twirled in the wind. Then resumed her run towards a massive grey ship with thick yellow lines and characters the size of buildings prindted on its starboard port side  that read "E-0003". Next he spotted a man running, tightly holding his boys and girls as he struggled to follow his wife who also had her arms around another child. They ran in the direction of another ship. And finally, he barely made out the shape of a tall four armed creature carrying large bright yellow containers with bold black markings. As he boarded a tiny rectangular ship that looked like a rather large television remote, his heavy footstep echoed in the station like deep timpani drums.

The thousands of engines started to growl, as the last late few boarded their ships. All blast doors whirring closed on after the other. Then they snapped shut one by one like giant game slot cartridges. 

As soon as the last door shut, without wasting a second, he strummed his keyboard on the see through tablet. White light lit the transparent screen at the touch highlighting his white gloves.

" Launch Conductor to Expedition Leaders. All explorers are aboard. Over." The conductor signaled to the radio coms on his wrist watch. 

" Copy that Launch Conductor. Over. " A pilot replied. 
" Copy. Over. " Another said. 
" Copy, Launch Conductor. Over " a third repeated. 
" You are go for launch. Over. " the conductor responded. 
" Received. Over. Thank you Launch Conductor " thanked the first pilot.
" Well received. Over.  " the second said. 
" Received. Over. Let's light this candle. Over.  " answered the third. 

And as the rose evening sky started to set and as the engines started ignition, the flames and sparks illuminated the empty platform.

Some ships roared out of the atmosphere and others sailed to the horizon all while the conductor's lonely silhouette stood on the now empty white platform.

What once was peaceful and prosperous worlds is now just remnants and fragments of ancient and aging civilizations. Now, scavengers, warmongers and power hungry lords rule the systems.

But there, past the skeleton field, do you see ? Past the tank and ship carcasses that covered the bright bushy fields that went on to the horizon, lay a figure. -->
