### Author

This is a story of war, a poem of life and the tales of people.

Tempted by greed, lust, envy and power. Challenged by war, death and time. Tested by jealousy, anger and truth. Our characters will venture out into the unknown to meet great triumph or impending doom or nothing at all... But at the end of the day, this is the fight of good versus evil.
