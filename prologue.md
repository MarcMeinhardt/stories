**Author's notes – An Epic Fight**

This is a story of war, a poem of life and the tales of people.

These are the stories of children, teens and adults no different from you or me. 
Tempted by greed, lust, envy and power. Challenged by war, death and time. Tested by jealousy, anger and truth. Our characters will venture out into the unknown to meet great triumph or impending doom or nothing at all... But at the end of the day, this is the fight of good versus evil.



**Prologue – Millenium**

Lightning struck. The choir chanted. The violins played. And the drums, they rumbled. 

And... slowly, it started to rain. It rained crystal glass, stained by red blood.

Soldiers fell. 

Men fell.


War. That’s what started and ended everything. Thousands of years of greed and blood lust shaped it all, from the shard like mountains, scattered the space debris that left traces of titanic explosions frozen in time, the makeshift cityscapes like mechanical mold.
War, it shaped all you see before you. 

What once was peaceful and prosperous worlds is now just remnants and fragments of ancient and aging civilizations. Now, scavengers, warmongers and power hungry lords rule the systems.

But there, past the skeleton field, do you see ? Past the tank and ship carcasses that covered the bright bushy fields that went on to the horizon, lay a figure.


Then, with one big bang, the night skies lit up like a trillion stars.

And everything went dark. 

Everything went dark for a really really long time…
